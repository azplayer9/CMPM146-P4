This project involved creating a decision tree for an AI playing the game "Planet Wars." This game involves capturing planets by sending out fleets of spaceships to either enemy or allied planets. 

The decision tree that I created took a more greedy approach to the game, trying to minimize the required number of fleets to send to take over a planet. 
It also prioritized attacking planets with the highest resource growth rate, which would lead to a larger net growth in the long run. 
It did have some defensive maneuvers, though, making sure to protect the smaller planets it controlled by sending reinforcements from a larger nearby planet.
